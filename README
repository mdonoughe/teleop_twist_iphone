This ROS node allows you to teleoperate your robot from your iPhone/iPod/iPad.

The robot node must understand Twist messages. X is forward. Rotations are done
about the Z axis.

The iPhone/iPod/iPad/other must support WebSockets and touch events. I've only
tested this with my iPod.

The computer running the node must have Tornado installed. The version in
Ubuntu's repository is too old.

The maximum speed is adjustable by setting the ~maximum_linear_speed and
~maximum_angular_speed parameters. These default to 0.5 and 0.5.

WARNING:
I should probably warn you now that during the use of this node, you may:
 * Bump the edge of the screen, causing the robot to rapidly accelerate,
   throwing lose equipment off, and crashing into something.
 * Lose your network connection is such a way that the server does not notice
   until the connection times out, causing the robot to continue driving like
   as it has been until it crashes into something. This could be fixed by
   stopping the robot if no updates are received in a certain time period, and
   having the client send periodic messages to keep the connection alive.
This code may cause physical damage to you, your robot, your environment, etc.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Instructions:
 * Run the node.

 * Connect to http://<host>:3000/ from Safari on your iPhone. You should see a
   white screen with a crosshair in the middle. Red indicates means that you are
   not connected to the node.

 * Carefully drag your finger around the screen. The middle of the screen is
   (0, 0). Dragging up will cause the robot to drive forward. Down is reverse.
   Left and right cause the robot to turn. Dragging away from the center
   increases the speed. Removing your finger from the screen will cause the
   robot to stop.
