This ROS node allows you to teleoperate your robot from your iPhone/iPod/iPad.

The robot node must understand Twist messages. X is forward. Rotations are done
about the Z axis.

The iPhone/iPod/iPad/other must support WebSockets and touch events. I've only
tested this with my iPod.

The computer running the node must have Tornado installed. The version in
Ubuntu's repository is too old.

Instructions:
 * Run the node.

 * Connect to http://<host>:3000/ from Safari on your iPhone. You should see a
   white screen with a crosshair in the middle. Red indicates means that you are
   not connected to the node.

 * Carefully drag your finger around the screen. The middle of the screen is
   (0, 0). Dragging up will cause the robot to drive forward. Down is reverse.
   Left and right cause the robot to turn. Dragging away from the center
   increases the speed. The maximum speeds are 0.5 and 0.5. Removing your finger
   from the screen will cause the robot to stop.
